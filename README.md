# How-to-enable-the-new-Roblox-Studio-Icons.

All of this will function if you have a Roblox beta account that is registered.
Log into your beta account, then click new or the UPDATE tab in the top right to see your Roblox Studio updates.
I'm sorry, but you weren't included in the 5.4% who received the icons if you don't see any associated ICONS in the news or update tabs.
Now that it's enrolling to early beta developers first since they're handling them personally and not automatically, I'm quite sure that in a day and a half you will get it granted.

From now on, you'll probably get it in a day and a half or two.

If not, you can reach out to me on Discord at Origin#3312
I'll be assisting you in getting the icons handed out (without any enrolled beta updates or handled access by roblox themselves)
